This is an alternative approach to the existing split-ssh. 
I didnt want an approach that loaded all of ssh-agent in to every
client qube.
I have many keypairs, and they will be accessed from different qubes.
So although the ssh-agent qube will hold all the keyapirs, individual
qubes will be restricted to particular keys.
Specification also required a solution that contained no information in
the client, and all interaction is to be controlled in dom0 by the
policy file.
