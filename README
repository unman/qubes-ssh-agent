This is an alternative approach to the existing split-ssh. 
I didnt want an approach that loaded all of ssh-agent in to every
client qube.
I have many keypairs, and they will be accessed from different qubes.
So although the ssh-agent qube will hold all the keyapirs, individual
qubes will be restricted to particular keys.
Specification also required a solution that contained no information in
the client, and all interaction is to be controlled in dom0 by the
policy file.

ssh-agent:
Standard set-up for multiple agents, configured by systemd user.

dom0:
Standard policy file:
qubes.SshAgent -
client @anyvm ask,target=tester

client:
socat to take over ssh-agent socket, and forward call via qrexec.
`socat -v UNIX-LISTEN:$SSH_AUTH_SOCK,unlink-early EXEC:"qrexec-client-vm @dispvm qubes.SshAgent"`
